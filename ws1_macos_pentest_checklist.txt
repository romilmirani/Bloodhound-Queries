Workspace ONE UEM macOS Managed Image - Testing Checklist
===========================================================

0. Baseline & Setup
-------------------
[ ] Record device model, serial (obfuscated), macOS version, and build.
[ ] Confirm your account type (standard vs admin).
[ ] Confirm Workspace ONE Intelligent Hub is installed and enrollment is complete.
[ ] Save the WS1 security controls / SDD document for reference.

1. Enrollment Flow & Onboarding
-------------------------------
[ ] Walk through the full enrollment using the provided enrollment code.
[ ] Note all information required during enrollment (credentials, MFA, etc.).
[ ] Confirm bootstrap package installation (WS1 agent, Octory/status bar, core security tools).
[ ] Capture screenshots of important enrollment screens and user prompts.

2. Compliance Engine Behaviour
------------------------------
[ ] Verify current compliance status of the device in WS1 (Compliant / Not Compliant).
[ ] Confirm that disk encryption/FileVault status is correctly detected by WS1.
[ ] Confirm that OS version meets or exceeds the minimum required version.
[ ] Discuss/verify expected behaviour for non-compliant devices (notifications, tags, access control).
[ ] Check what actions occur when a device becomes non-compliant (where feasible).

3. Passcode & Session Policy
----------------------------
[ ] Attempt to set a weak password and confirm it is rejected if below policy.
[ ] Confirm password complexity requirements (length, alphanumeric, complexity).
[ ] Verify auto-lock / screen lock behaviour matches policy.
[ ] Verify screen saver and “require password after sleep/screensaver” behaviour.
[ ] Confirm automatic login is disabled.

4. Login Window & Accounts
--------------------------
[ ] Confirm Guest account is disabled (if required by policy).
[ ] Confirm only expected users are visible at the login window.
[ ] Verify fast user switching / console access settings match policy.
[ ] Verify login options (e.g., show list of users vs username/password) match policy.
[ ] Confirm login access is restricted as per documentation (local vs network users, etc.).

5. FileVault2 / Disk Encryption
-------------------------------
[ ] Confirm FileVault2 is enabled and disk is fully encrypted.
[ ] Confirm device prompts for password on boot (no bypass).
[ ] Verify recovery key escrow behaviour with WS1 admin (no key exposure to tester).
[ ] Confirm WS1 console shows the device as encrypted and compliant.

6. System Settings / Preference Pane Restrictions
-------------------------------------------------
[ ] For each preference pane listed as Disabled, confirm it is blocked or greyed out.
[ ] For each pane listed as Enabled, confirm it opens but respects hardening settings.
[ ] In Sharing, verify ability/inability to enable file sharing, screen sharing, remote login, etc.
[ ] In Users & Groups, confirm you cannot create additional admins as a standard user.
[ ] In Profiles, confirm you cannot remove MDM or security profiles.

7. Hostname Enforcement
-----------------------
[ ] Attempt to change the computer name/hostname.
[ ] Observe whether WS1 or workflows revert the hostname to the enforced value.
[ ] Confirm hostname in WS1 console matches the enforced format.

8. iCloud & Apple Services
--------------------------
[ ] Attempt to sign in with a personal Apple ID and note which services are allowed.
[ ] Verify which iCloud services are enabled/disabled (Drive, Mail, Calendar, Contacts, Notes, Keychain, Desktop & Documents).
[ ] Confirm Apple Intelligence/Genmoji/writing tools are blocked if required.
[ ] Confirm Handoff, iPhone mirroring, and other Apple features match the documented configuration.

9. Media, USB & Sharing
-----------------------
[ ] Test external USB/disk access (read and write) according to policy.
[ ] Confirm AirDrop is disabled where required.
[ ] Verify which sharing services appear in share sheets (Mail, Messages, social media) and that disabled ones are absent.
[ ] Confirm screen capture and remote screen observation permissions match policy.

10. Security & Privacy Controls
-------------------------------
[ ] Verify Gatekeeper is configured to allow only App Store and identified developers.
[ ] Confirm users cannot weaken Gatekeeper settings where they should be locked.
[ ] Test running App Store apps, signed apps, and unsigned binaries; note what is blocked/allowed.
[ ] Verify diagnostic data/analytics to Apple are disabled if required.
[ ] Verify Location Services behaviour matches documentation (including any “user may opt out” options).
[ ] Confirm remote login / remote management / screen sharing state matches policy.
[ ] Confirm root access is disabled or restricted according to policy.

11. Installed Security Stack & System Extensions
------------------------------------------------
[ ] Confirm installation and operation of each security tool (Cisco Secure Client, CyberArk PEDM, Trellix, Encase, Tanium, Tenable, Zscaler, etc.).
[ ] As a standard user, attempt to stop or uninstall each security agent and note results.
[ ] Confirm non-removable system extensions cannot be removed or disabled.
[ ] Verify web content filters / Zscaler / Trellix controls are in effect for web browsing.
[ ] Check for simple bypasses using alternate browsers or basic evasion (within agreed rules).

12. Local Admin Rights Workflow
-------------------------------
[ ] Confirm your default account is a non-admin user.
[ ] With the admin/engineer, test the self-service local admin process (AD group → WS1 app → local admin).
[ ] Verify that after running the app, your user becomes local admin as intended.
[ ] Assess whether the workflow can be abused (e.g., re-run to add other accounts, permanent elevation).
[ ] After gaining admin, test whether you can remove WS1 profiles or disable security tools.

13. WS1 Agent, Profiles & Re-enrollment Hardening
-------------------------------------------------
[ ] Confirm WS1 Intelligent Hub and MDM profiles are present on the device.
[ ] As a standard user, attempt to remove the MDM enrollment profile; confirm it is blocked.
[ ] If you gain local admin, attempt to remove the MDM profile or WS1 agent and note behaviour.
[ ] Change a WS1-managed setting (e.g., hostname, sharing option) and observe if WS1 re-applies it.
[ ] Confirm that significant tampering leads to a non-compliant state and/or alerts in WS1.

14. Data Protection & Exfiltration (Test Data Only)
---------------------------------------------------
[ ] Attempt to copy sample test files to external USB/disk.
[ ] Attempt to upload sample test files to personal cloud storage services (if accessible).
[ ] Attempt to send sample test files via personal email/webmail.
[ ] Attempt to capture screens or use screen sharing to exfiltrate visible content.
[ ] Note any DLP, conditional access, or other controls that prevent or detect these actions.

15. Logging, Alerting & Console Visibility
------------------------------------------
[ ] For key actions (policy changes, local admin elevation, attempted profile removal, etc.), verify logs in WS1 console.
[ ] Confirm that relevant events are captured with sufficient detail (who, what, when).
[ ] Confirm that non-compliance is reflected in WS1 and any integrated security tools.
[ ] Identify which actions generate alerts or tickets, and which are silently logged.

16. Wrap-Up & Reporting
-----------------------
[ ] Map each WS1/macOS control from the design document to observed behaviour (works / partial / bypassed).
[ ] Document each identified gap with steps, impact, and realistic attacker use case.
[ ] Draft remediation recommendations (WS1 profile changes, additional controls, or workflow changes).
[ ] Prepare screenshots and command outputs as evidence (with sensitive details redacted where necessary).
